Snoop on a serial line, using two serial ports.

Requires a breakout box that connects in the middle of a serial line, and tees
the TXD line to RXD on one of the listening serial ports, and RXD to RXD on the
other listening serial port.

          TXD --------+--------------------------------- TXD
    DCE               |                                       DTE
          RXD ----+------------------------------------- RXD
                  |   |
          GND ------+----------------------------------- GND
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
  Port 0  RXD ----+ | +------- RXD  Port 1
                    |
          GND ------+--------- GND

There is nothing in the software that forces port 0 to listen to the DCE and
port 1 to listen to the DTE, and there will be no major difference in the
program's output if you swap them, except for the port names changing.

(At some stage the software will change to monitor the serial port control
lines, and then the listening ports will be required to be connected to the DCE
or DTE in a particular order.)
