Snoop on a serial line, using two serial ports.


This can work in two ways:


1. Monitor only

Requires a breakout box that connects in the middle of a serial line, and tees
the TXD line to RXD on one of the listening serial ports, and RXD to RXD on the
other listening serial port.

          TXD --------+--------------------------------- TXD
    DCE               |                                       DTE
          RXD ----+------------------------------------- RXD
                  |   |
          GND ------+----------------------------------- GND
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
                  | | |
  Port 0  RXD ----+ | +------- RXD  Port 1
                    |
          GND ------+--------- GND

There is nothing in the software that forces port 0 to listen to the DCE and
port 1 to listen to the DTE, and there will be no major difference in the
program's output if you swap them, except for the port names changing.

At some stage the software will change to monitor the serial port control
lines, and then the listening ports will be required to be connected to the DCE
or DTE in a particular order.


2. Passthrough

Does not need a breakout box, as data read from one serial port is passed
through to the other.


          TXD -----\ /---------------------------------- TXD
  Port 1            X                                         DTE
          RXD -----/ \---------------------------------- RXD

          GND ------------------------------------------ GND


          TXD ------------------------------------------ TXD
  Port 2                                                      DCE
          RXD ------------------------------------------ RXD

          GND ------------------------------------------ GND


Similarly to the Monitor mode, there is nothing that tells you which port to
connect to the DTE or DCE.  But when we change to monitoring the serial port
control lines, the ports will be fixed.
