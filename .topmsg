Subject: Make serialsnoop optionally operate in a pass-through mode.

The main reason for this is to reduce the hardware requirements for
operation.  Currently we need a special breakout box with four ports:
DTE, DCE, DTE monitor and DCE monitor.  In a pass-through mode we need
only a null modem for one of the ports (plus associated cabling.)
